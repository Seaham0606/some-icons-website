# Migration to React

This project has been fully migrated to React. The vanilla HTML files have been backed up in the `vanilla-backup/` directory.

## Build Process

### Development
```bash
# Run React dev server (with HMR)
npm run dev:react

# Or run the Express server (serves built React app or vanilla fallback)
npm run dev
```

### Production Build
```bash
# Build React app (outputs to /dist)
npm run build

# The server.js will automatically serve from /dist if it exists
```

## File Structure

- `/react` - React application source code
- `/dist` - React build output (generated by `npm run build`)
- `/vanilla-backup` - Backup of original vanilla HTML files
- `/assets` - Static assets (images, CSS for vanilla pages)
- `/content` - Content files (changelog markdown files)

## What Changed

1. **Main Entry Point**: The React app is now the primary entry point
2. **Routing**: All routes (`/`, `/changelog`, `/generator`) are handled by React Router
3. **Styling**: React app uses Tailwind CSS (no longer uses `site.css` for inputs)
4. **Input CSS Removed**: Input/select CSS removed from `site.css` since React uses Tailwind

## Server Configuration

The `server.js` file:
- Serves the React app from `/dist` if it exists (production)
- Falls back to vanilla HTML files if React build doesn't exist
- Handles SPA routing (all routes serve React app's index.html)
- Still provides API endpoints for changelog generation

## Vanilla Files Status

The following vanilla HTML files are backed up but no longer the primary entry point:
- `index.html` (backed up)
- `generator/index.html` (backed up)
- `changelog/index.html` (backed up)

These can be safely removed once you've verified the React app works correctly in production.
